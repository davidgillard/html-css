        One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a
        horrible
        vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly,
        slightly
        domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to
        slide
        off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly
        as
        he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a
        little
        too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the
        table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an
        illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa
        who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor
        then
        turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops
